GetAndCleanData
===============

Student repository for Coursera.com online MOOC, 'Getting and Cleaning Data', June 2014

Overview

The run_analysis.R performs the required functions to tidy data as required for the course. The script is nearly
completely automated, pausing to allow the user to enter a keystroke to choose whether to run the script and to select
formatted data file output.

The script requires the packages: utils, reshape2. If you don't have them installed, I recommend you do so before you 
run the script.

The data for the project was originally obtained from:   http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The data description is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.
The data was acquired by a Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone.
